## How this site was built:

Hello! I just wanted to add some notes here as to how the site is constructed and why I believe it demonstrates the knowledge required by the sylabus:

### Other Projects
For the sake of demonstrating experience, some other projects I've done are:

- [Wiki Yggdrasil](github.com/alex/0112/yggdrasil): A wikipedia spidering and graph visualization tool (now archived). Built in React/Rails. I was hosting it on Heroku's free tier until [they discontinued it](https://devcenter.heroku.com/changelog-items/2461). When it functioned it would allow a user to paste a wikipedia URL and (after validating it) generate a D3 graph of linked articles.

- [Silence Between The Notes](https://silence-between-the-notes.surge.sh/): This was a very very small proof of concept I hacked together for a friend one evening. It's really just an interface for a [javascript library](https://www.vexflow.com/) that renders muscial staffs to a webpage.

- [Techcyte](https://techcyte.com/products/automated-blood-differential/) At a job I had in 2014 I was responsible for standing up a web application that read machine learning data from a database and allowing a medical tech to correct or annotate images of blood cells. I was responsible for the front end all the way up until the database read. My understanding is that the app has changed significantly since then but you can still view a screenshot of it with some updated styles on the linked page.
